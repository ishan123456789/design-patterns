Behavioral design patterns are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects.

In these design patterns, the interaction between the objects should be in such a way that they can easily talk to each other and still should be loosely coupled.

Some design patterns:

- [Chain of Responsibility Pattern]()
- [Command Pattern]()
- [Interpreter Pattern]()
- [Iterator Pattern]()
- [Mediator Pattern]()
- [Memento Pattern]()
- [Observer Pattern]()
- [State Pattern]()
- [Strategy Pattern]()
- [Template Pattern]()
